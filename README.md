## About the Project

This is just a simple to do list application. It allows you to add your todos. There is a feature that allows you to mark your todos as completed and a delete button to get rid of a todo item as need be. The footer of the application keeps track of completed and total todos. I chose to use React for this project because I have been wanting to learn it for a while and have been dedicating time for it. This is my first official application using this library. Had a bit of difficulty with some of my event handling and functionality of the app. Along with implementing State which was confusing since it was my first app using React but I was able to figure it out. It was a great learning experience and I'm excited to build my next application!
